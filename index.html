     <h2>Non-linear Dynamics & Chaos </h2>
     <p> Dynamics is a mathematical philosophy concerned with how change occurs. A change is non-linear, in a mathematical sense, when it cannot be described by a numeric constant or a proportional variable. Chaos is the belief that mathematically defined rules can generate unpredicted, and unpredicatable, results.</p>

       <mtable>
	<mtr><mi>x&prime; = cos(x)</mi></mtr>
	<mtr><mi>x&prime; = sin(x)</mi></mtr>
       </mtable>
       <p>Each equation above can be read as: "x prime = cosine of x" </p>
       <p>The prime symbol (&prime;) indicates the derivative value of the associated variable. In other words, x prime is the derivative value of x. </p>
